Description:             This example demonstrates how to use the Windows Installer XML (WiX) toolset
                         to deploy a Measurement Studio application in Visual Studio 2012. WiX is
                         the preferred deployment solution for Measurement Studio projects in Visual 
                         Studio 2012.
                         
                         The main project WiX file is Product.wxs. This file must be edited before
                         the setup project will build successfully.
